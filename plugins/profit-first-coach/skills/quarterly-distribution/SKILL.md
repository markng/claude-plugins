# Quarterly Distribution Calculator

Calculate how to distribute the accumulated profit at quarter end. Supports multiple strategies including standard distribution, debt destruction, and accelerated vault building.

## When to Use

Use at the end of each quarter (March 31, June 30, September 30, December 31) to determine how to handle the money accumulated in the PROFIT and PROFIT HOLD accounts.

## Input Required

1. **Profit Account Balance**: Total in PROFIT + PROFIT HOLD accounts
2. **Distribution Strategy**: Which approach to use
3. **Outstanding Debt** (if using debt destruction): Amount of business debt
4. **Vault Target** (optional): Desired emergency fund size

## Distribution Strategies

### Strategy 1: Standard Distribution (Default)

The classic Profit First approach:
- **50% to Owner** - Your reward for running a profitable business
- **50% to Vault** - Builds emergency reserves

This is the recommended default for most businesses.

### Strategy 2: Debt Destruction

Aggressive debt paydown while maintaining the profit habit:
- **95-99% to Debt Paydown** - Crush one debt at a time
- **1-5% to Celebration** - Small reward to maintain motivation

Use this when paying down business debt is the priority.

### Strategy 3: Accelerated Vault Building

When you need to build emergency reserves faster:
- **25% to Owner** - Reduced but still present reward
- **75% to Vault** - Faster emergency fund growth

Use when vault is underfunded and you want to build security faster.

### Strategy 4: Growth Reinvestment

For businesses ready to invest in growth:
- **25% to Owner** - Maintain reward
- **25% to Vault** - Continue building reserves
- **50% to Growth** - Dedicated growth investment

**Caution**: Only use when business is stable and vault is funded.

## Example Calculations

### Example 1: Standard Distribution
**Profit Balance: $4,000**

| Destination | Percentage | Amount |
|-------------|------------|--------|
| Owner (Reward) | 50% | $2,000.00 |
| Vault (Reserves) | 50% | $2,000.00 |
| **Total** | **100%** | **$4,000.00** |

### Example 2: Debt Destruction
**Profit Balance: $4,000**
**Target Debt: Credit Card at $8,000**

| Destination | Percentage | Amount |
|-------------|------------|--------|
| Debt Paydown | 97% | $3,880.00 |
| Celebration | 3% | $120.00 |
| **Total** | **100%** | **$4,000.00** |

*The $120 celebration might be a nice dinner - small but meaningful.*

### Example 3: Accelerated Vault
**Profit Balance: $4,000**
**Vault Target: $30,000 (currently $5,000)**

| Destination | Percentage | Amount |
|-------------|------------|--------|
| Owner (Reward) | 25% | $1,000.00 |
| Vault (Reserves) | 75% | $3,000.00 |
| **Total** | **100%** | **$4,000.00** |

*Vault grows from $5,000 to $8,000 this quarter.*

## The "Jab-Jab-Hook" Method (Debt Destruction)

For aggressive debt paydown:

1. **Jab**: Regular small payments from OpEx throughout the quarter
2. **Jab**: Continue regular payments
3. **Hook**: Quarterly profit distribution knockout punch

This combination of steady payments plus quarterly lump sums destroys debt faster than either approach alone.

## Vault Guidelines

### Target Vault Size
- **Minimum**: 3 months of operating expenses
- **Ideal**: 6 months of operating expenses
- **Calculate**: Monthly OpEx × 3 (or 6)

### When Vault is Funded
Once vault reaches target:
- Switch to standard 50/50 distribution
- Vault portion becomes retained earnings
- Consider increasing owner distribution percentage

### When to Access Vault
**Only in genuine crisis:**
- Revenue collapse
- Major unexpected expense
- True emergency

If you're accessing the vault, you need to make changes in your business. This is the last resort, not a convenience fund.

## Strategy Selection Guide

| Situation | Recommended Strategy |
|-----------|---------------------|
| Starting out, no debt | Standard (50/50) |
| Have business debt | Debt Destruction |
| Vault under 3 months OpEx | Accelerated Vault or Standard |
| Vault funded, no debt | Standard or Growth |
| Stable, ready to grow | Growth Reinvestment |

## Important Reminders

1. **This is YOUR money** - Profit is the reward for running a business, enjoy it guilt-free
2. **Never skip distribution** - Even a small distribution maintains the habit
3. **Celebrate something** - Even in debt destruction mode, take 1-5% to celebrate
4. **Record in state file** - Track each quarterly distribution
5. **Review strategy quarterly** - Circumstances change, strategies should too

## Owner Distribution Uses

The owner's portion can be used for anything:
- Personal savings
- Personal debt paydown
- Vacation fund
- Investment
- Pure enjoyment

**This is not business money anymore.** It's your personal reward.
