# Target Allocation Percentages (TAPs) Reference

This document contains the complete TAP tables from the Profit First methodology by Mike Michalowicz. For the complete methodology, see the book "Profit First" at [profitfirstbook.com](https://profitfirstbook.com).

## What Are TAPs?

Target Allocation Percentages (TAPs) are the ideal percentages for allocating revenue to each account. They represent where you want to be, not necessarily where you start.

**Key principle**: Start with your Current Allocation Percentages (CAPs) - what you're actually doing today - then gradually move toward TAPs over time.

## Standard TAP Table by Revenue Level

These are the official Profit First TAPs based on **Real Revenue** (see calculation below):

| Real Revenue | Profit | Owner's Pay | Tax | Operating Expenses |
|--------------|--------|-------------|-----|-------------------|
| $0 - $250K | 5% | 50% | 15% | 30% |
| $250K - $500K | 10% | 35% | 15% | 40% |
| $500K - $1M | 15% | 20% | 15% | 50% |
| $1M - $5M | 10% | 10% | 15% | 65% |
| $5M - $10M | 15% | 5% | 15% | 65% |
| $10M - $50M | 20% | 0% | 15% | 65% |

### Key Observations

- **Profit increases with scale**: Small businesses start at 5%, growing to 20% at $10M+
- **Owner's Pay decreases**: Starts at 50% for small businesses, drops to 0% at scale (owners pay themselves through profit distributions instead)
- **Tax stays constant**: 15% across all levels covers self-employment and income tax
- **OpEx grows**: Larger businesses have more operational complexity

## Calculating Real Revenue

**Real Revenue = Total Revenue - Materials & Subcontractors**

### When to Use Real Revenue

Only calculate Real Revenue if materials and subcontractors exceed **25% of Total Income**. Otherwise, use Total Revenue directly.

### What Counts as Materials & Subcontractors

**Include:**
- Raw materials and components
- Third-party subcontractors
- Pass-through costs tied directly to delivering product/service
- Per-project contractors (only paid for income-generating work)

**Do NOT Include:**
- Employee wages (even if "direct labor")
- Fixed overhead
- Rent, utilities
- Regular team payroll

### Example Calculation

A home builder has:
- Total Revenue: $10M
- Materials & Subcontractors: $7M
- **Real Revenue: $3M**

This business operates on the $1M-$5M TAP tier, not the $5M-$10M tier.

## Industry-Specific TAP Variations

Different industries have different cost structures. These are guidelines - work with a Profit First Professional for customization.

### Service Businesses (Low Overhead)

Examples: Consultants, coaches, freelancers, chiropractors

| Account | Target % |
|---------|----------|
| Profit | 5-15% |
| Owner's Pay | 50% |
| Tax | 15% |
| OpEx | 20-30% |

Service businesses typically have higher margins and can allocate more to profit and owner's pay.

### Professional Services (Higher Overhead)

Examples: Dentists, medical practices, law firms

| Account | Target % |
|---------|----------|
| Profit | 10% |
| Owner's Pay | 13% |
| Tax | 10% |
| OpEx | 67% |

Higher overhead from facilities, equipment, and staff.

### Contractors & Construction

Examples: General contractors, plumbers, HVAC, electricians

| Account | Target % | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| COGS/Materials | 65-70% | Dedicated account for materials |
| Profit | 10-20% | Specialists (plumbers, HVAC) aim higher |
| Owner's Pay | Varies | |
| Tax | 15% | |
| OpEx | 15-25% | |

Contractors need a dedicated COGS account due to high materials pass-through.

### E-Commerce & Retail

Examples: Online stores, physical retail

| Account | Target % |
|---------|----------|
| Inventory | Varies | Dedicated account required |
| Profit | Based on Real Revenue | |
| Owner's Pay | Based on Real Revenue | |
| Tax | 15% | |
| OpEx | Based on Real Revenue | |

Use Real Revenue (Total Revenue minus Inventory costs) for TAP calculations.

### Restaurants & Food Service

High materials cost, tight margins, significant labor.

| Account | Target % |
|---------|----------|
| Food Cost | 25-35% | Dedicated account |
| Labor | 25-35% | May need dedicated account |
| Profit | 5-10% | Margins are tight |
| Owner's Pay | 5-10% | |
| Tax | 15% | |
| OpEx | 15-25% | |

## Moving from CAPs to TAPs

**Never jump straight to TAPs.** This can starve your business of operating cash.

### The 3% Rule

Each quarter, move your allocations by no more than 3 percentage points:
1. Identify which CAP is furthest from its TAP
2. Adjust by 1-3% toward the target
3. Subtract that percentage from another account (usually OpEx)
4. Repeat next quarter

### Example Progression

Starting CAPs for a $200K business:
- Profit: 1% (TAP: 5%)
- Owner's Pay: 40% (TAP: 50%)
- Tax: 10% (TAP: 15%)
- OpEx: 49% (TAP: 30%)

**Quarter 1**: Move Profit 1% → 3%, OpEx 49% → 47%
**Quarter 2**: Move Owner's Pay 40% → 43%, OpEx 47% → 44%
**Quarter 3**: Move Profit 3% → 5%, Tax 10% → 12%, OpEx 44% → 40%
...and so on until reaching TAPs.

## Important Notes

- **TAPs are targets, not rules**: Every business is unique
- **Consult a Profit First Professional** for customized percentages
- **Real Revenue matters**: Product businesses must calculate correctly
- **Industry benchmarks vary**: Use these as starting points, not absolutes
- **Gradual change prevents crisis**: Rushing to TAPs can crash your business
