# Profit First Bank Accounts Guide

This document covers all Profit First bank accounts from Mike Michalowicz's methodology: the core five, the hold accounts, and advanced accounts for specific needs. For the complete methodology, see the book "Profit First" at [profitfirstbook.com](https://profitfirstbook.com).

## The Core Five Accounts

Every Profit First implementation starts with five checking accounts at your primary bank.

### 1. INCOME (Checking)

**Purpose**: Temporary holding for all revenue

- All deposits land here first
- Money stays here only until allocation day (10th or 25th)
- Think of it as a "serving platter" - money comes in, gets distributed out
- Should be nearly empty after each allocation

### 2. PROFIT (Checking)

**Purpose**: Your reward for running a profitable business

- Allocated first, before anything else
- **Do not touch** for operating expenses - ever
- Quarterly distribution: 50% to owner, 50% to Vault (see Hold Accounts)
- This is not emergency money or working capital

### 3. OWNER'S PAY (Checking)

**Purpose**: Your compensation as the business owner

- Pay yourself a regular salary from this account
- Separate from profit distributions
- Helps establish consistent personal income
- At scale, this may reduce to 0% as owners take profit distributions instead

### 4. TAX (Checking)

**Purpose**: Set aside money for tax obligations

- Covers self-employment tax, income tax, quarterly estimates
- Avoids the "tax time panic" of not having money
- Transfer to Tax HOLD account at separate bank (see below)
- When quarterly taxes are due, pay from Tax HOLD

### 5. OPERATING EXPENSES (Checking)

**Purpose**: All day-to-day business expenses

- Rent, utilities, software, supplies, payroll
- **Only pay bills from this account**
- If OpEx can't cover an expense, you can't afford it
- Forces expense discipline - the constraint is the feature

## Hold Accounts (At a DIFFERENT Bank)

**Critical**: Set up these accounts at a completely separate bank from your primary accounts. This removes the temptation to "borrow" from them.

### PROFIT HOLD (Savings)

**Purpose**: Long-term storage of profit allocations

- Transfer profit from PROFIT checking to PROFIT HOLD regularly
- Out of sight, out of mind
- Quarterly: distribute 50% to owner, keep 50% building the Vault
- Should be inconvenient to access

### TAX HOLD (Savings)

**Purpose**: Secure storage for tax obligations

- Transfer from TAX checking to TAX HOLD
- Pay quarterly estimates and annual taxes from here
- Keeps tax money completely separate from operating cash
- You'll never accidentally spend your tax money

### Why a Separate Bank?

- **Friction prevents borrowing**: Extra steps to transfer money
- **Psychological separation**: Money feels "gone" from the business
- **Removes temptation**: Can't see the balance when checking main accounts
- **Emergency only**: The inconvenience is intentional

## Advanced Accounts

Add these after you've mastered the basic system (at least 2-3 quarters). Each serves a specific purpose.

### VAULT (Savings - Separate Bank)

**Purpose**: Long-term emergency fund for the business

**How it works:**
- Funded from the 50% of Profit that doesn't go to owner distributions
- This is your "rainy day fund" for true emergencies
- Target: 3-6 months of operating expenses

**When to access:**
- Only in times of genuine crisis
- If you're accessing the Vault, you need to make changes in your business
- This is your last resort, not a slush fund

**Building the Vault:**
- Takes 1-2 years to fully fund
- Don't rush it - consistency matters more than speed
- Each quarter's profit sediment adds up

### DRIP (Checking)

**Purpose**: Manage prepayments, retainers, and seasonal income

**Use cases:**
- **Retainer businesses**: Hold client retainers until earned
- **Seasonal businesses**: Smooth income across slow months
- **Annual contracts**: Distribute lump payments over time
- **Prepayments**: Don't spend money for work not yet done

**How it works:**
1. Deposit prepayment/retainer into DRIP account
2. Transfer earned portion to INCOME on allocation days
3. Only allocate money you've actually earned

**Example**: Client pays $12,000 annual retainer
- Deposit $12,000 to DRIP
- Each month, transfer $1,000 to INCOME
- Allocate from INCOME as normal

### EQUIPMENT (Savings)

**Purpose**: Accumulate funds for planned capital purchases

**How it works:**
1. Identify future equipment needs and costs
2. Calculate monthly/quarterly contribution needed
3. Subtract from OpEx allocation percentage
4. Transfer to Equipment account each allocation day

**Example**: Need $10,000 for equipment in 8 months
- $10,000 ÷ 8 months = $1,250/month
- If that's 2% of revenue, reduce OpEx by 2%
- Transfer 2% to Equipment each allocation

**Benefits:**
- Pay cash instead of financing
- Negotiate discounts for cash payment
- No debt, no interest
- Planned rather than reactive purchases

### MATERIALS / INVENTORY (Checking)

**Purpose**: Dedicated account for product businesses' direct costs

**Who needs this:**
- Product businesses
- E-commerce sellers
- Manufacturers
- Retailers
- Any business where materials exceed 25% of revenue

**How it works:**
- Calculate your materials percentage of revenue
- Allocate that percentage before applying TAPs to remaining Real Revenue
- Pay all materials/inventory costs from this account only

**Example**: 40% of revenue goes to materials
- $10,000 revenue → $4,000 to Materials account
- Apply TAPs to remaining $6,000 (Real Revenue)

### PAYROLL (Checking)

**Purpose**: Separate employee payroll from other expenses

**Who needs this:**
- Businesses with employees
- Anyone who wants clearer payroll visibility

**Benefits:**
- See exactly what payroll costs
- Never accidentally spend payroll money
- Clearer OpEx picture (non-payroll expenses)
- Easier payroll tax management

### DEBT DESTRUCTION (Savings)

**Purpose**: Accelerated debt paydown

**How it works:**
- Dedicate a percentage of revenue to debt destruction
- Or use quarterly profit distributions for debt paydown

**The "Jab-Jab-Hook" Method:**
1. Regular small payments from OpEx (jab, jab)
2. Quarterly: take 95-99% of profit distribution to crush debt (hook)
3. Keep 1-5% for celebration (you earned it)
4. Repeat until debt-free

**When to use:**
- Existing business debt you want to eliminate
- Credit card balances
- Equipment loans
- Lines of credit
