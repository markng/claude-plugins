# Profit First Implementation Guide

This document covers how to implement Mike Michalowicz's Profit First methodology successfully, including prerequisites, common mistakes, and when the methodology may not be the right fit. For the complete methodology, see the book "Profit First" at [profitfirstbook.com](https://profitfirstbook.com).

## Prerequisites

Before implementing Profit First, ensure these foundations are in place.

### 1. Clean Books

**Your bookkeeping must be accurate and up-to-date.**

Profit First is a cash-based system. The numbers must reconcile exactly to actual cash collected. If your books are a mess:
- Categorization errors will distort your CAPs
- You won't know your true Real Revenue
- Allocation percentages will be based on wrong data

**Before starting:**
- Reconcile all bank accounts
- Categorize transactions correctly
- Understand your actual revenue and expenses
- Consider hiring a bookkeeper if needed

### 2. Consistent Bookkeeping

You need ongoing bookkeeping discipline, not just a one-time cleanup.

- Weekly or biweekly transaction categorization
- Monthly reconciliation at minimum
- Clear separation of business and personal expenses

### 3. Separate Business Banking

If you're mixing personal and business finances:
- Open dedicated business accounts first
- Establish clean separation
- Then implement Profit First on the business accounts

### 4. Understanding of Your Numbers

You should be able to answer:
- What is your monthly revenue (average)?
- What are your fixed vs. variable expenses?
- What do you currently pay yourself?
- What percentage goes to materials/subcontractors?

## The Allocation Rhythm: 10th and 25th

Profit First allocations happen twice monthly, on the 10th and 25th.

### Why Twice Monthly?

- **Prevents "big deposit, big spend" cycle**: Money doesn't sit in income accumulating temptation
- **Forces regular financial engagement**: You review finances 24 times per year
- **Smoother cash flow**: More frequent, smaller allocations

### The Allocation Process

1. **Check INCOME account balance**
2. **Calculate allocations** based on your current percentages
3. **Transfer to each account**: Profit → Owner's Pay → Tax → OpEx
4. **Move Profit and Tax to HOLD accounts** at separate bank
5. **Pay bills only from OpEx**

### If Dates Don't Work

You can adjust the dates, but maintain the twice-monthly rhythm. Some alternatives:
- 1st and 15th
- 5th and 20th
- Match to your pay periods

## Gradual Implementation

**Never jump straight to target percentages.** This is the most common mistake.

### The Problem with Going Too Fast

If your current profit percentage is 0% and you immediately allocate 5%:
- OpEx suddenly has 5% less
- You may not be able to pay bills
- Panic ensues, you "borrow" from profit
- System fails, you give up

### The 3% Rule

Each quarter, adjust allocations by no more than 3 percentage points total.

**Example starting position:**
| Account | Current (CAP) | Target (TAP) | Gap |
|---------|---------------|--------------|-----|
| Profit | 0% | 5% | -5% |
| Owner's Pay | 35% | 50% | -15% |
| Tax | 10% | 15% | -5% |
| OpEx | 55% | 30% | +25% |

**Quarter 1**: Profit 0%→2%, OpEx 55%→53%
**Quarter 2**: Owner's Pay 35%→38%, OpEx 53%→50%
**Quarter 3**: Profit 2%→4%, Tax 10%→12%, OpEx 50%→46%

### Start Small

Even 1% to profit is meaningful:
- It builds the habit
- It proves the system works
- It creates momentum
- Small wins lead to bigger ones

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### 1. Skipping Allocation Days

Inconsistency kills Profit First. Set calendar reminders and treat allocation day as non-negotiable.

### 2. "Borrowing" from Profit

The moment you take from Profit for expenses, the system breaks. If OpEx can't cover something, you can't afford it.

### 3. Miscalculating Real Revenue

For product businesses: only subtract materials and third-party subcontractors. Employee wages are NOT subtracted.

### 4. Setting TAPs Too Aggressively

Jumping to ideal percentages too fast will crash your cash flow. Gradual change is essential.

### 5. Not Using a Separate Bank for Hold Accounts

If Profit and Tax HOLD are at the same bank, you'll be tempted to transfer back. The friction of a separate bank is intentional.

### 6. Forgetting to Cut Expenses

Profit First works by constraining OpEx. If you don't actively reduce expenses as you increase profit percentage, the math won't work.

### 7. Treating Profit as Emergency Fund

Profit is your reward, not your safety net. That's what the Vault is for. Don't conflate them.

### 8. Ignoring the System When Times Are Good

When revenue is high, it's tempting to relax. Keep allocating. Good times build your Vault and profit reserves for bad times.

### 9. Going It Alone When Struggling

Profit First Professionals exist for a reason. If you're struggling, get help rather than abandoning the system.

### 10. Not Updating CAPs as You Grow

As revenue changes, recalculate your CAPs and ensure you're on track toward appropriate TAPs for your new revenue level.

## When Profit First May Not Fit

Profit First is powerful but not universal. It may not be ideal for:

### Highly Seasonal Businesses

**Challenge**: Revenue varies dramatically by season
- Slow season allocations leave you short for peak season prep
- Peak season allocations may be too conservative

**Mitigation**: Use DRIP accounts to smooth seasonal income, but this adds complexity.

### Long Operating Cycles

**Challenge**: You spend money long before you're paid
- Construction projects spanning months
- Manufacturing with long lead times
- Service projects with milestone billing

**Mitigation**: May need working capital or credit facilities that don't fit the pure Profit First model.

### High-Growth Reinvestment Phase

**Challenge**: Business needs to reinvest most revenue to grow
- Startups seeking rapid expansion
- Businesses actively investing in market share

**Consideration**: Profit First may slow growth by extracting cash. This is a feature for sustainable businesses, but may not fit aggressive growth strategies.

### Very Thin Margins

**Challenge**: Margins are so tight that any profit extraction threatens viability
- Commodity businesses
- Highly competitive low-margin industries

**Reality Check**: If you can't extract even 1% profit, you may have a business model problem, not a Profit First problem.

### Inconsistent Revenue

**Challenge**: Revenue is unpredictable month-to-month
- Project-based businesses with lumpy income
- Businesses dependent on a few large clients

**Mitigation**: Longer averaging periods, DRIP accounts, larger OpEx reserves.

### Cash Flow vs. Profitability

**Important**: Profit First creates cash flow discipline. It doesn't inherently create a profitable business model. If your pricing, costs, or margins are fundamentally broken, Profit First will expose that - but it won't fix it.
